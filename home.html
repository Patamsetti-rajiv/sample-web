        PESTICIDE
    </h2>
    <p style="color:red">Pesticides are chemical substances that are meant to kill pests. In general, a pesticide is a chemical or a biological agent such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant that deters, incapacitates, kills, pests.</p>
    
    <p style="color: blue;"> Pesticides are not recent inventions. Many ancient civilizations used pesticides to protect their crops from insects and pests. Ancient Sumerians used elemental sulfur to protect their crops from insects. Whereas, Medieval farmers experimented with chemicals using arsenic, lead on common crops.</p>
   <p  style="color:green"> The pesticides which we  sell in our shop are well recognised by the the government and even we  make many farmers to know the use and importance of  the pesticide we use</p>
<p style="color:blueviolet"> Today as the days passed the pests  getting the strength to bear the natural pesticides by the farmers so the traditional pesticides which our ansisters used may not effect the pests that are present nowadays</p>
